# AI Applications in the Legal Sector

The legal sector was once looked at as a profession deeply rooted in human intellect and tradition but is now evolving and being redefined through technological innovation. Law firms and in-house legal departments have seen the rapid integration of AI systems in day-to-day activities, with 82% of lawyers now using or planning to use AI, a sharp increase from 39% in 2023. AI applications in the legal sector are diverse, encompassing tasks such as document analysis, contract intelligence, legal research, case outcome prediction, just to mention a few.

In document review, analysis, and automation, AI tools rapidly analyze and generate documents, identify risks, and ensure compliance, accelerating tasks such as due diligence and contract review by processing large volumes of data in minutes and using predefined templates to generate precise, consistent, and compliant documents. This has shown over a 60% reduction in time used for these tasks.

**Additional Research**: Tools like Kira Systems reduce contract analysis costs by 40%, while global adoption reached 85% in 2025 per recent surveys.
